Resources to get started and teach yourself data science. These resources are suitable for students in low and medium income countries (LMICs). 

These resources give you the absolute basics to teach yourself data science at home. I assume you have a basic computer, an internet connection and a drive to learn.

* Learn programming (especially C and/or Python and/or R)

    * https://github.com/neelsoumya/programming_resources 

* Learn basic statistics

    * https://github.com/neelsoumya/basic_statistics

* Start an open source open data project on a topic you are really interested in. For example, see the following:

    * https://github.com/neelsoumya/public_open_source_data_science




* If you get stuck or want to learn the basics of statistics, consult the free ISLR book

    * https://www.statlearning.com/s/ISLRSeventhPrinting.pdf
